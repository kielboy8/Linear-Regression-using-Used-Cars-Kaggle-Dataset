# Linear Regression using Used Cars Dataset
This is a simple linear regression project just to test my skills in Data Science. The model predicts the price of a car based from factors such as year bought, mileage, city it was bought from, and the state.
It was created using Jupyter Notebook and makes use of scikit-learn and statsmodels.
